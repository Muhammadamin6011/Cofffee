                <p class="p">Coffeeroasters began its journey of exotic discovery in 1999, <br> highlighting stories of
                    coffee from around the world. We have <br> since been dedicated to bring the perfect cup - from bean
                    to <br> brew - in every shipment.</p>

                <p class="p2">We’re built on a simple mission and a commitment to doing good along the way. We want to
                    make
                    it easy for you to discover and brew the world’s best coffee at home. It all starts at the source.
                    To
                    locate the specific lots we want to purchase, we travel nearly 60 days a year trying to understand
                    the
                    challenges and opportunities in each of these places. We collaborate with exceptional coffee growers
                    and
                    empower a global community of farmers through with well above fair-trade benchmarks. We also offer
                    training, support farm community initiatives, and invest in coffee plant science. Curating only the
                    finest blends, we roast each lot to highlight tasting profiles distinctive to their native growing
                    region.</p>

                <p class="p3">Although we work with growers who pay close attention to all stages of harvest and
                    processing, we employ, on our end, a rigorous quality control program to avoid over-roasting or
                    baking the coffee dry. Every bag of coffee is tagged with a roast date and batch number. Our goal is
                    to roast consistent, user-friendly coffee, so that brewing is easy and enjoyable.</p>
